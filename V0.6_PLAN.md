# V0.6 Implementation Plan: Groups Foundation

## Overview

Add the ability to create groups and manage members. This is the foundation for V0.9's group calendar feature.

---

## Issues Addressed in This Plan

| Issue | Risk | Solution |
|-------|------|----------|
| RLS self-reference complexity | Hard to audit, potential inefficiency | Use `IN (UNION)` pattern — single subquery, clear access paths |
| Missing `remove_group_member` RPC | Inconsistent with CLAUDE.md rules | Added RPC with error codes |
| Missing `create_group` RPC | Name validation not in single source of truth | Added RPC with validation + error codes |
| Direct member insert/delete | Bypasses validation | RLS policies block direct access; only RPC allowed |
| Trigger vs RPC for auto-add creator | Complexity | Removed trigger; creator added atomically in `create_group` RPC |
| `CANNOT_ADD_SELF` redundant | Confusing error codes | Removed; `ALREADY_MEMBER` covers this case |
| Owner can't see members if not in group_members | Owner locked out of management | Owner path in UNION is a **safety net only** (see I2/I11 note below) |
| Race condition on 20-member limit | Could exceed limit with concurrent requests | Added trigger constraint to enforce at DB level |
| Missing creator membership (I11 violation) | Data integrity bug, owner lockout | Self-healing in RPCs + RLS safety net (see I2/I11 note) |

---

## Core Invariants

| # | Invariant | Enforced By |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| I1 | User can only see groups they belong to | RLS on `groups` |
| I2 | User can only see members of groups they belong to | RLS on `group_members` (includes owner check) |
| I3 | User can only create groups for themselves | RLS + RPC |
| I4 | Only creator can add members | RPC + RLS blocks direct insert |
| I5 | Only creator can remove members | RPC + RLS blocks direct delete |
| I6 | Only creator can delete group | RLS on `groups` |
| I7 | User cannot be added twice | DB UNIQUE constraint |
| I8 | Max 20 members per group | DB trigger (SQLSTATE GF001) + RPC check |
| I9 | Group name 3-30 characters | DB CHECK constraint + RPC |
| I10 | Creator cannot remove themselves | RPC |
| I11 | Creator is always a member | RPC atomic insert + self-healing in RPCs |

> **I2/I11 Clarification — Missing Creator Membership is INVALID STATE**
>
> | Question | Answer |
> |----------|--------|
> | Is missing creator membership valid? | **No.** It is a data integrity bug (I11 violation). |
> | Why does RLS include owner path? | **Safety net only.** Prevents total lockout during bugs. |
> | Can code depend on owner path? | **No.** All code must assume I11 holds. |
> | What if membership is missing? | **Self-heal.** RPCs silently reinsert creator before proceeding. |
>
> The RLS owner override exists to prevent catastrophic lockout, not as a design pattern. RPCs include defensive self-healing: if the creator's membership row is missing, they reinsert it automatically. This ensures the bug is corrected on next interaction without user-visible errors.

> **I8 Clarification — Custom SQLSTATE for Trigger Exception**
>
> | Layer | Mechanism | SQLSTATE |
> |-------|-----------|----------|
> | Primary | RPC checks `COUNT(*) >= 20` before insert | N/A (returns `GROUP_FULL` directly) |
> | Fallback | DB trigger raises exception on race condition | `GF001` |
> | Handler | RPC catches `SQLSTATE 'GF001'` specifically | Maps to `GROUP_FULL` |
>
> The trigger uses a custom SQLSTATE (`GF001`) instead of string matching. This ensures deterministic exception handling: the RPC catches **only** the GROUP_FULL trigger exception and maps it to the correct error code. Generic `RAISE EXCEPTION` without ERRCODE would fall through to `UNKNOWN_ERROR`.

> **Invariant Classification — Product Decisions vs Technical Necessities**
>
> | Type | Invariants | Rationale |
> |------|------------|-----------|
> | **Technical** | I1, I2, I3, I7, I11 | Security/integrity — cannot change without breaking the system |
> | **Product** | I4, I5, I6, I8, I9, I10 | Design choices — could evolve based on user needs |
>
> **Product decisions in V0.6 (single-owner model):**
>
> | Invariant | Current Behavior | Why This Way | V1.0 Evolution Path |
> |-----------|------------------|--------------|---------------------|
> | I4 | Only creator can add members | Simplicity; avoids permission complexity | Could add "admin" role or allow all members to invite |
> | I5 | Only creator can remove members | Members can't leave without creator action | Add `leave_group` RPC (member self-removes) |
> | I6 | Only creator can delete group | Single owner, no transfer | Could add ownership transfer or require 0 members first |
> | I8 | Max 20 members | Prevents abuse; keeps calendar view usable | Could make configurable or tiered by plan |
> | I9 | Name 3-30 chars | UX constraint | Could adjust bounds based on feedback |
> | I10 | Creator cannot remove self | Forces delete-group instead of orphan | Could allow if transferring ownership first |
>
> **V1.0 planned changes:**
> - `leave_group` RPC: Member can remove themselves (not creator) — relaxes I5 for non-owners
> - Delete group remains creator-only (I6 unchanged)
> - No ownership transfer in V1.0 (deferred to V1.x)

## Pre-Implementation Checklist (per CLAUDE.md)

### 1. Where is the single source of truth?
- **Groups**: `groups` table
- **Membership**: `group_members` table
- **Add member**: `add_group_member` RPC function (atomic, with error codes)

### 2. What are the exact result codes?

**Create Group:**
- `SUCCESS` - Group created
- `INVALID_NAME` - Name too short/long (3-30 chars)
- `UNAUTHORIZED` - Not logged in
- `UNKNOWN_ERROR` - Unexpected failure

**Add Member:** (8 codes, each appears exactly once)
- `SUCCESS` - Member added
- `GROUP_NOT_FOUND` - Group doesn't exist
- `NOT_OWNER` - Only creator can add members
- `USER_NOT_FOUND` - Username doesn't exist
- `ALREADY_MEMBER` - User is already in group (any user, including owner trying to re-add self)
- `GROUP_FULL` - Max 20 members reached
- `UNAUTHORIZED` - Not logged in
- `UNKNOWN_ERROR` - Unexpected failure

> Note: `CANNOT_ADD_SELF` was removed. When owner tries to add themselves, `ALREADY_MEMBER` is returned because they were auto-added on group creation. This is accurate and simpler than special-casing.

**Remove Member:**
- `SUCCESS` - Member removed
- `GROUP_NOT_FOUND` - Group doesn't exist
- `NOT_OWNER` - Only creator can remove members
- `CANNOT_REMOVE_SELF` - Creator cannot leave (must delete group)
- `MEMBER_NOT_FOUND` - User not in group
- `UNAUTHORIZED` - Not logged in
- `UNKNOWN_ERROR` - Unexpected failure

### 3. Can this operation partially succeed?
- **Create group**: No - single insert
- **Add member**: No - single insert via RPC
- **Remove member**: No - single delete

### 4. What happens if two users act simultaneously?
- **Add same member twice**: DB unique constraint prevents duplicates, RPC returns `ALREADY_MEMBER`
- **Remove while adding**: One succeeds, other gets appropriate error

### 5. How does the UI know the operation succeeded?
- All mutations return result codes
- UI refetches from DB after success (no state guessing)

### 6. What logic will be deleted to prevent duplication?
- N/A - new feature, no existing code

  created_at: string;
  member_count?: number; // Derived
  is_owner?: boolean;    // Derived

}
```

### Phase 3: Hooks

**useGroups.ts** - List groups, create group, delete group
**useGroupMembers.ts** - List members, add member, remove member

### Phase 4: Components

1. `GroupsPage.tsx` - List user's groups + create form
2. `GroupDetailPage.tsx` - View/manage single group
3. `CreateGroupForm.tsx` - Name input + submit
4. `GroupCard.tsx` - Display group in list
5. `GroupMembersList.tsx` - List members with avatars
6. `AddMemberForm.tsx` - Username input + submit

### Phase 5: Navigation

- Add "Groups" link to HomePage header
- Add route `/groups` and `/groups/:id`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create group with valid name (3-30 chars)
- [ ] Create group with invalid name (< 3 or > 30 chars) - should fail
- [ ] Creator is auto-added as member
- [ ] Add member by username
- [ ] Add member with invalid username - should fail
- [ ] Add duplicate member - should fail with ALREADY_MEMBER
- [ ] Non-owner tries to add member - should fail with NOT_OWNER
- [ ] Add 20th member - should succeed
- [ ] Add 21st member - should fail with GROUP_FULL
- [ ] Remove member (as owner)
- [ ] Non-owner tries to remove - should fail
- [ ] Delete group (as owner)
- [ ] RLS: User can only see groups they belong to
